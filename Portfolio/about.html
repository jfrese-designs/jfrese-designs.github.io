                <h1>Who Is J.Frese</h1>
                <p><em>From an engineering student to inventory prodigy to IT Service Professional  and UX/UI Designer.</em></p>

                <p>I started my higher education journey in the College of Engineering at K-State. From practicing advanced mathematics to creating architectural plans, I learned quite a bit on my way to being an Architectural Engineer. However, life happened and there seemed to be a different plan for me.</p>
                
                <p>The next chapter of J.Frese was about inventory and warehouse management. Over the next 20 years I used logic, math, Excel and SAP to become an inventory guru and climbed my way up to site supervisor. During that time I looked at completing an Engineering degree that I had started more than a dozen years before. However, at that time it wasn’t feasible to go back to college full time and I could not find a remote study program for engineering. It was then that I decided to follow another interest…IT. One of my hobbies is as a mechanic, so I decided to be a mechanic for computers and computer systems, specifically Networking and Network Architecture.</p>
                
                <p>I completed a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology, but did not move into the field right away as I was now moving up the leadership ladder for my company. I continued with warehousing and was looked at by a few places to be their operations manager. Life still had a different plan, none of those opportunities worked out, and my warehouse was distributed to other company facilities around the country and shut down.</p>
                
                <p>While cleaning out and shutting down the building I had been working in for the last 12 years, I earned a UX/UI Design certificate from Columbia University. In doing that I learned Figma and was reunited with HTML coding that I learned while completing my B.S. in IT. To see what I have done from there, please look at the case studies published on this site.</p>
